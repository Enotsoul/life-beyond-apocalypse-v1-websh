# Life Beyond Apocalypse Browser Game V1 (2 refactored versions)

**Unmaintained**
This is the first Life Beyond Apocalypse version I've ever built using Websh and Tcl
back in 2008~2010.
This can be installed and played by using Apache and compiling Websh.
You then need to run makeDb.ws3 to import the database.

I won't include compilation steps since I still remember the horror of compiling everything by hand. No linux packages available unfortunately.

The lbaold is the original version released in 2009
The lba is a newer refactored version from around 2011

There is a lot of code here and with this project i've learned a lot for DevOps, Linux, Programming (both frontend and backend)
